# Angular + Rails example

A simple library app (with a CRUD of book resources) to demo the integration between Angular and Rails.

I made this as a demo for my post about the [Rails + Angular equation](http://dev.mikamai.com/post/97732414859/the-rails-angular-equation-can-give-you-satisfaction)

## Setup

- `bundle install`
- `rake bower:install`
- `rake db:migrate`
- `rake db:seed`
